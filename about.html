    <h3>the details</h3>

    <p>my name is gus. i'm a photographer in slc. i shoot alot of stuff, most of my images are from walks in
    neighborhoods and around the city. i am on a quest to explore everything </p>
    <p>the physical inability to explore and observe the entire world constantly nags me, it frustrates me
      that i will not see everything but i try my best to capture the world through photography and hopefully
      my images will help you observe the world too</p>
